# Sparkbox Team Availability

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
1. Install all required dependencies `npm i`.
1. Start the development development server `npm run dev`.
1. Project is now running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 

## Development 

### PR Process 

1. Create a new branch consistent with the [Sparkbox git standard](https://github.com/sparkbox/standard/blob/main/code-style/git/README.md).  
1. Publish your local branch to GitHub.
1. Open a PR and assign a reviewer when your branch is ready.
1. All tests and all linting checks must pass before a PR can merge.
1. Before merging make sure your branch is caught up to `main`. See [Sparkbox git standard](https://github.com/sparkbox/standard/blob/main/code-style/git/README.md#rebasing-a-branch-onto-the-master-branch).   
1. **Verified** commits are required! see [Sparkbox standard](https://github.com/sparkbox/standard/blob/6127cbeedccf12b4c34bc5b0bfec3f721b765d3e/security/security_policy_compliance/verified-commits.md).

### Deployments 

When new code is pushed to `main` a new deployment is automatically deployed via Netlify to https://fellowship-availability.netlify.app. Additionally, preview deployments are automatically generated for each PR. On each PR look for a comment from Netlify for a link to the preview. Previews will automatically update when new commits are pushed to an open PR.
